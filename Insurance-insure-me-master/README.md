This is an Insurance Domain Project named insure-me. 

In this project I have used Following tools:-

1) Git - For version control for tracking changes in the code files
2) Jenkins - For continuous integration and continuous deployment
3) Docker - For deploying containerized applications
4) Ansible - Configuration management tools
5) Selenium - For automating tests on the deployed web application
6) AWS : For creating ec2 machines as servers and deploy the web application.
   
Note:-
In order to run the application use port 8081..
